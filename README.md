# LRP1 Project

This repo contains code pertaining to the LRP1 modeling project (based off of modeling cardiomyocyte apoptosis)

## Folder Index

**LRP1 Upstream Model:** "most recent" code of the since expanded LRP1 model to include more reactions upstream. Includes most updated model spreadsheet, sensitivity analysis, and validation. 
* Planning to do:
  * Virtual drug screen of LRP1 model, potential analysis with PathLinker
  * Model revision
      
**LRP1 Model Simulations:** running Python simulations of the original LRP1 model and perturbations, mainly in the context of myocardial infarction. Mostly work done during my rotation in fall 2023.

**Monika Apoptosis Paper Figures:** replicating Krabowska et al. (2021) paper figures on Python.
